Description             : Stylish, high-tech weapon mod for MBF21 ports,
                          serving as a new-DEHACKED feature showcase.
                          Features a shiny new roster of weapons that
                          will make you say "I can't believe it's not
                          GZDoom!"

                          Field Agent Vesper Montgomery was expecting an
                          intelligence-gathering mission, not a full-on
                          demonic outbreak. Nevertheless, with an arsenal
                          of plasma shotguns, acid grenades, arcane blood
                          sprayers, and indestructible eyeglasses on hand,
                          why not kick some ass while in the neighborhood?

                          Vesper is a Doomforge project, hosted by the
                          fine folks at Hellforge Studios. Check out
                          https://hellforgestudios.com/doomforge/ for
                          more kickass Doom stuffs, and hop on our
                          Discord to chat (and/or vent) about the mod!

May Not Run With...     : Non-MBF21-supporting ports. This project has been
                          extensively tested with dsda-doom; any other port
                          is currently at "swim at your own risk" stage;
                          there will be more cross-port testing n' fixes
                          before the super-final release of this project,
                          but for now, when in doubt, stick with dsda-doom.

===========================================================================
* Port Compatibility *

Vesper uses MBF21 features, and requires a port that supports the standard.

Officially Supported ports:
- DSDA-Doom (recommended for Singleplayer) -- 0.22.5 or later
- Odamex (recommended for Multiplayer) -- 10.1.0 or later
- Woof -- 8.1.0 or later
- DelphiDoom -- 2022-05-01 update or later

Nearly-Supported ports:
- Eternity -- devbuilds only, not yet supported in latest official release
- GZDoom -- ditto

Other ports and versions may work if they've received updates since the
time of writing, so feel free to try it out on your favorite port, but
that's a "swim at your own risk" thing. ;)

===========================================================================
* Wad Compatibility *

Vesper is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of classic Boom
megawads, even those that use DEHACKED. As long as the wad doesn't make
use of the extended DEHEXTRA state range (there will usually be some note
in the text file saying as such), it will probably work.

One known exception is STRAIN -- it uses a sprite renaming trick to work
around a vanilla Doom bug, which unfortunately mucks up Vesper's sprites.

Additionally, Vesper includes a custom palette that may conflict with wads
that also modify the palette. BTSX and Ancient Aliens in particular will
not work at the time of writing (though a support patch for these in the
future isn't out of the question ;).

When in doubt, give it a try! You may be surprised what works.
